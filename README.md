# Modulated_sim

## Summation of codes from final year project

This project aims at dealing with SRAS raw data.

Modulated components and procedures from prviously tested codes.

---

1. Modelling signal of SRAS.  
2. Fourier Transform.  
3. Frequency seperation.  
4. Image processing.

## To access result from mass prc

Use the following commands in terminal.

```matlab
size(stArr_simresult) % to verify its dimensions
% then choose desired coordinates for following figures
g1 = stArr_simresult(1,1,11,11,4,1).initg1
g2 = stArr_simresult(1,1,11,11,4,1).initg2
res = stArr_simresult(1,1,11,11,4,1).val_corr
```
